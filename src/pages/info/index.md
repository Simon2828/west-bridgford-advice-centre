**Universal Credit: <https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit>**

**NOTE**: NEW benefit claimants in Nottinghamshire must now claim Universal Credit for what was :-

* Child Tax Credit
* Housing Benefit
* Income Support
* Income-based Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance (JSA)
* Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
* Working Tax Credit

and this **MUST** be done online, so you will need to create an account on the Universal Credit system and have an email account of your own already set up.  We can help with this.
